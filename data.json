An initial is an oversize capital letter, sometimes outdented beyond the margin of text. This style can be seen, for example, in the original Old English manuscript of Beowulf. Outdenting is still used in English typography, though not commonly.[4] Initials and rubrication were used in the Gutenberg Bible, the first major book to be printed rather than hand-written.",
